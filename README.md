### 

Hello my name is Jacek (English pronunciation: YAAtzehk) and I'm a London based Front-End Developer ðŸ‘‹

My recent experience consists of working on three different projects through the open source platform Chingu. In the last six months, I have had hands-on experience working in a remote Agile team environment and developing web applications with a global team.

My background in hospitality has provided me with many transferable skills, including communication skills, team leading, management and problem solving. These have turned out to be key to the successful development of web applications and bringing my team together when faced with specific challenges.

I'm looking for my first commercial role as a Front End Developer to further my growth as a developer and to put my skills to work in professional work environment.
