Hello my name is Jacek (english pronunciation: YAAtzehk) ðŸ‘‹

My recent experience consists working on the open source platform provided by the Chingu Organisation. In the last six months I had hands-on experience on working in remote Agile team environment and developing web applications with teams consisted of people from across the world. 

My backround hospitality experience has provided me many transferable skills such as communication and team leading that turned out to be a key for a successfulll development of the applications and bringing the team together. 

I'm looking for my first commercial role as a Front End Developer to further my growth as a developer and to put my skills to work in professional work environment.
