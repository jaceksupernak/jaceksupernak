Hello, my name is Jacek (English pronunciation: YAAtzehk), and I'm a Dublin (Ireland) based Front-End Developer ðŸ‘‹.

As a passionate front-end developer, I specialize in creating mobile-first, responsive designs. My expertise is further enhanced by my proficiency in a wide range of modern web technologies, including TypeScript, NextJS, ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, Styled Components, S(CSS), and Tailwind.

My experience spans working in diverse, international teams, where I've thrived in remote, cross-continental projects, demonstrating strong skills in Agile/Scrum methodologies. I'm particularly proud of my ability to lead and collaborate in dynamic environments, bringing innovative web solutions to life.

With over 2 years of professional experience, including team projects and freelance work, I've honed my skills in both technical development and soft skills like communication, team leadership, and problem-solving. These skills were significantly developed in my most impactful role at TeamForward, where I was deeply involved in developing location-based features and enhancing user experience.

In every project, I'm committed to proactive problem-solving and continuous learning, often going beyond my assigned tasks to improve overall application robustness and user satisfaction.
